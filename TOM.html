       The Basics
      </h2>
      <p>
        Tournament of Minds consists of 4 disciplines:
        <li>The Arts</li>
        <li>STEM</li>
        <li>Language Literature</li>
        <li>Social Sciences</li>
      </p>
      <p>Teams are required to work together on a Long Term Challenge for six weeks without assistance from teachers, parents or peers. They are encouraged to explore possibilities and experiment with ideas as they endeavour to produce their best possible solution. They develop a creative and original way to communicate this solution to others, working within predefined parameters such as limited materials, complex challenge criteria and the deadline of Tournament Day.</p>
      <p>
        Students present the product of their ideas - their challenge solution - to a panel of judges and an audience on Tournament Day. They have ten minutes in which to present and must do so within a 3 metre by 3 metre performance area.</p>
      <p>
        The teams must also participate in an unseen Spontaneous Challenge on Tournament Day. This challenge requires rapid interchange of ideas, the ability to think creatively and well developed group cooperation skills.</p>

      <h2>My Experience with T.O.M</h2>
      <p>I Have been competing in Tournament of Minds since I was 10 years old, the first time I competed my team chose the Arts and even though that was around the start of the pandemic we still had a great time, we didn't make it past Regionals that year. The next year TOM was canceled because of covid, despite this our facilitators (the teachers who orgasised it) decided to hold a mock competition for just our school, this time my team chose STEM. I honestly can't remember much about that year other than that we went into lockdown halfway through our challenge.</p> 
      <p> The next time I competed I was in my first year of intermediate school, and this changed everything, for the first time we had acesses to a proper workshop, wood and most excitingly a 3d Printer. For our Regional challenge we chose STEM and as part of our solution we built a hologram box which lead us to win and have a shot at competing in the national final. At nationals we were presented with a new kind of challenge, previously we had six weeks to come up with a solution, write a skit and practice. but at nationals we only had three hours. </p>
